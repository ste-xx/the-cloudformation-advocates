This year, AWS introduce [AWS Lambda Layer][1]. 
Layers are great to create a shared runtime.
With [AWS Lambda-backed Custom Resources][2]
exists the possibility to extend cloudformation templates, with own cloudformation functions.
These Lambda function required a specialisd flow.
They *must* return a state, otherwise your customresources blocks your stack for at least one hour, which is a pain in the ass.
